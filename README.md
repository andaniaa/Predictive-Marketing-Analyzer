# Predictive-Marketing-Analyzer

Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction

This project analyzes a bank marketing dataset to predict client subscription to a financial product following a marketing campaign. Using machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover key patterns and characteristics in client data that indicate higher likelihoods of subscription.

The workflow includes:

=Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, assess data quality, and visualize any missing values or imbalances in the target variable.

=Data Preprocessing: Prepares the data for modeling by handling missing values, normalizing features, and performing feature engineering and selection using mutual information methods.

=Modeling: Trains several classifiers, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM, and boosting algorithms, to predict subscription likelihood.

=Evaluation: Measures model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best-performing model.
